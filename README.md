for the frontend, we cloned the minimal-UI-kit repo. you can read the documentation here: https://docs.minimals.cc/introduction. headings "Routing" and "Structure & Flow" are especially useful.

To run the project, first clone the repository locally.

Then, set REACT_APP_URL=http://localhost:3001. Other .env variables are confidential.
